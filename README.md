Hospital Readmissions Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts hospital readmissions using the "Hospital Readmissions" dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to explore factors influencing readmissions and build predictive models to assist healthcare providers in reducing readmission rates.
Dataset
•	Source: Kaggle - Hospital Readmissions: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions
•	Description:
  The dataset contains information about hospital encounters, including patient demographics, diagnoses, number of inpatient visits, medications, lab results, and whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days.
Project Structure
•	Data Preprocessing
o	Handling missing values
o	Encoding categorical variables
o	Feature selection and scaling
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Understanding patient demographics
o	Analyzing relationships between features and readmission rates
•	Modeling
o	Logistic Regression
o	Random Forest
o	XGBoost
o	Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, and Recall
•	Interpretation
o	Feature importance analysis
o	Discussion of results and healthcare implications
Tools and Libraries
•	Python 3.11+
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	scikit-learn
•	matplotlib / seaborn
•	xgboost
•	imbalanced-learn (for dealing with class imbalance)
How to Run
1.	Clone the repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-readmissions-prediction.git
3.	cd hospital-readmissions-prediction
4.	Install required packages:
5.	pip install -r requirements.txt
6.	Run the notebooks or scripts:

8.	Follow the project workflow:
o	Data Cleaning ➔ EDA ➔ Model Training ➔ Evaluation
Results
•	Achieved an accuracy of 53.2% 
•	Identified key factors impacting readmission rates such as number of inpatient visits, discharge disposition, and diagnoses.
Future Work
•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
•	Deep Learning models (e.g., simple Neural Networks)
•	Deployment of the model using Flask or Streamlit
